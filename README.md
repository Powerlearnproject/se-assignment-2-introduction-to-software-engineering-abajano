# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Answer; It is a systematic approach to designing, developing, testing and maintaining software.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

Software Engineering applies scientific and discreet mathematical principles to the design, development, analysis and implementation of software systems while programming entails the writing of codes to solve problems.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

- It is a structured process thst is applied to achieve the production of high-quqlity low-cost software in the shortest time possible.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

REQUIREMENTS- Collecting and recording user needs and system requirements

DESIGN- Conforming the software architecture  and user interface into high-level and detailed designs

IMPLEMENTATION- Writing the code and building the software in line with the design so created

TESTING- Testing the software to ensure it conforms to the quality standards and effectiveness.

DEPLOYMENT- Releasing the software to the users.

MAINTENANCE- Subjecting the software to ongoing support, updates and further enhancements i.e Conducting system updates

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Agile is the iterative and incremental approach towards achieving flexibility, collaboration and responding to change while Waterfall is the downward flow of sequences characterized by didtinctive phases e.g requirements, design, testing, implementation etc

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

Agile is the iterative and incremental approach towards achieving flexibility, collaboration and responding to change while Waterfall is the downward flow of sequences characterized by didtinctive phases e.g requirements, design, testing, implementation etc
Agile approach is instrumental in the maintenance stage while waterfall approach is prefered in the building stages of the software upto deployment stage.



Requirements Engineering:



What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.


Requirement engineering is the process of gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.


Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity is creation of software in a manner that minimizes dependencies among the components of a system. It enhances readability and reusability also allowing for easier scalability as systems grow in complexity leading to more manageable and sustainable systems over time.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

- Unit testing: Tests individual units of the application for correctness.
- Integration testing: Tests the interraction between different systems.
- System testing: Testing of a fully inttegrated software product. it is performed in the context of a System Requirement Specification[SRS].
- Acceptance testing: Tests the behavior of a software product and it is expressed as an example or a usage scenario.

Testing is important in that it involves the finding of errors snd defects with a view to improve consistency and performance. It thus helps a team in understanding actual and expected outcomes towards improving the product.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Version control systems involve the tracking changes to documents and files in the process of software development thus keeping the team informed on real time progress. Using a version control system ensures that you can find any information required with ease thus saving time while keeping potential errors at bay.

- GITHUB: Is a version control system and repository to host Git projects. It is popularly known as the social media for software developers for the fact that it helps them collaborate and maintain the complete history of code changes. THE features of GITHUB include a card-based project management tool.

- MERCURIAL: It is a free distributed version control system. It's features include being fast, platform independent, open source and easy to use

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

- The role of a software project manager is to manage and co-ordinate the entire project and is key in it's successful completion. The responsibilities of a software project manager include writing project proposal, scheduling, staffing, software process tailoring, project monitoring and control, risk management amongst many others. Given the expansive nature of their responsibility, they are bound to face challenges such as resource allocation, scope creep, poor planning and unrealistic timelines leading to a substandard product in the end etc 


Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

- Software maintenance is the process of changing, modifying and updating software to be at breast with customer needs. 

- The different types of maintenance activities include corrective[fixing defects], adaptive[adapting to the environment], perfective[enhancing functionality] and preventive[preventing problems]. Maintenance is essential because it ensures that the software is functioning as it was designed to function repairs are performed as needed to discount malfunction.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

- Ethical issues faced y software engineers include conflict of interest, data integrity, societal impact, accountability, confidentiality breach etc.

- Software engineers can ensure adherence to ethical standards by implementing encryption to protect user data, do no harm, compliance with laws, protect confidentiality, be trustworthy and honest in their undertakings, prioritize accountability etc

Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
